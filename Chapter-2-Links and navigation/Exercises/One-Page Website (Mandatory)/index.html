            <p>Tony Stark. Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist. Son of Legendary Inventor, Sciencetist and Weapons Contractor Howard Stark.<br><br>
                In order to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, Tony Stark is given a ride to a desert in Afghanistan.<br>
                That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee is attacked by terrorists. Luckily, He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart.<br>
                In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else - His Escape.<br> 
                Thus The Iron Man is Born. He uses the primitive devices to cobble together a powersuit and escape from the cave. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit.<br>
                But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries during Tony's Absence has plans of his own...</p>

                <h4>Surprisingly Well Done</h4>
                Much against the hype, I thought this movie would have been torrid trash acting mingled with cheesy fight scenes. 
                I mean Robert Downey Jr as an action superhero? But I am glad to admit that I misjudged the movie completely. 
                Downey played a very good Tony Stark, in generally every way. From his jokes to his obnoxious lifestyle he looked and walked the part very well. 
                His banter with his right hand assistant Ms. Pepper Potts isn't mind numbing and actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the wit. 
                The movie itself moved at a very good pace. Mixing action, comedy and some drama to just about the right proportions. 
                As with most superhero movies, its rather predictable, but in all the right ways you'd want a superhero movie to be. 
                The animation used was almost seamless, and of course the Iron Man costume was kicking major ass.
